            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I initially obtained my Bacholers in Biology with a specialization in Neuroscience from the University of Maryland, College Park
              before continuing on to the University of California, San Diego to pursue a Ph.D in Neuroscience. During my experience
              as a neuroscientist I taught myself some basic coding skills first using MatLab and then moving on to Python out
              of necessity in order to be able to analyze and process code. Then early on in my neuroscience Ph.D I discovered
              Bitcoin as well as smart contract blockchains such as Ethereum. I became enamored with blockchains and spent most of
              my free time learning about them and exploring how to use them. After saving some money and leaving my Ph.D, I began
              decided to spend a year becoming much more proficent at coding so I could work in the blockchain industry in order
              to build interesting and valuable products. This website will document this journey.

            <h2>My Coding Goals</h2>
            <p>My current goal is to learn full stack development in order to build interactive websites. My initial short term goal
              is to learn how to use GraphQL queries in order to work with the Lens Protocol api and present data in a way that
              users find it easy to observe.
