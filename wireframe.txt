Goal: Make a website describing my coding experience and why I am interested in coding

Title: "Andre DeSouza's Coding Journey"

About Me Section
I initally obtained my bacholers in Biology with a specialization in Neuroscience from the University of Maryland College Park
before continuing on to the University of California, San Diego to pursue a Ph.D in Neuroscience. During my experience
as a neuroscientist I taught myself some basic coding skills first using MatLab and then moving onto Python out
of neccesity in order to be able to analyze and process code. Then early on in my neuroscience Ph.D I discovered 
Bitcoin as well as smart contract blockchains such as Ethereum. I became enamored with blockchains and spent most of
my free time learning about them and exploring how to use them. After saving some money and leaving my Ph.D, I began
decided to spend a year becoming much more proficent at coding so I could work in the blockchain industry in order
to build interesting and valuable products. This website will document this journey.
